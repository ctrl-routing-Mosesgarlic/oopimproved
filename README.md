# Drink Business RMI System

A distributed Java RMI-based drink business management system with SSL security, featuring headquarters (HQ) server, branch servers, and a JavaFX GUI client with comprehensive automation scripts for easy deployment across multiple machines.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Automation Scripts

### For Linux/macOS Users
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x run-system.sh

# Run the system manager
./run-system.sh
```

### For Windows Users
```cmd
# Run the system manager
run-system.bat
```

The automation scripts provide:
- **Dynamic IP Detection**: Automatically detects your network IP for multi-machine deployment
- **Interactive Menus**: Choose between HQ Server, Branch Servers, or GUI Client
- **Database Seeder Integration**: Option to seed database before starting servers
- **Server Selection for GUI**: Choose which server to connect to when running the client
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All activities logged to `record.log`, errors to `errors.log`
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Main Server (Headquarters)
- **SSL-secured RMI server** on port **1099**
- Manages global data: drinks, customers, users, branches
- Hosts JavaFX GUI dashboards for: Admin, Customer Support, Auditor, Global Manager
- Provides comprehensive reporting and user management capabilities

### Branch Servers
- **Nairobi Branch**: Port **1103**
- **Kisumu Branch**: Port **1102** 
- **Mombasa Branch**: Port **1101**
- **Nakuru Branch**: Can run as HQ or Branch server

Each branch acts as a standalone RMI server handling local stock, order placement, and customer access.

### JavaFX GUI Client
- Modern JavaFX interface with role-based dashboards
- SSL-secured connections to servers
- Real-time order management and stock tracking
- User authentication and authorization
- Dynamic server selection and connection

## üë• User Roles and Access Levels

| Role | Access Location | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Admin | HQ | Manage users, drinks, and view all reports |
| Customer Support | HQ | View customers and resolve order issues |
| Auditor | HQ | View sales/stock reports from all branches |
| Global Manager | HQ | Monitor all orders and performance |
| Branch Manager | Branch | Manage local stock and view branch sales |
| Branch Staff | Branch | Place orders and update stock |
| Customer | HQ or Branch | Browse drinks and place orders |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Script-Related Issues

1. **Script Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)**
   ```bash
   chmod +x run-system.sh
   ```

2. **IP Detection Failed**
   - Script falls back to localhost automatically
   - Check network connectivity
   - Manually specify IP when prompted for "Custom IP"

3. **Maven Not Found**
   - Install Maven: `sudo apt install maven` (Ubuntu) or `brew install maven` (macOS)
   - Ensure Maven is in system PATH

4. **Java Not Found**
   - Install OpenJDK 17+: `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`
   - Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

### System Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Ensure MySQL is running: `sudo systemctl start mysql`
   - Verify credentials (root/12345)
   - Check if database `drinkdb` exists
   - Run database seeder through script menu

2. **RMI Registry Errors**
   - Ensure ports 1099-1103 are available
   - Check firewall settings: `sudo ufw allow 1099:1103/tcp`
   - Verify Java RMI is properly configured

3. **SSL Connection Issues**
   - Verify keystore files exist in `config/` directory
   - Check keystore password (password123)
   - Ensure SSL certificates are properly generated

4. **GUI Connection Failed**
   - Verify target server is running
   - Check IP address and port configuration
   - Try connecting to localhost first
   - Review error logs in `errors.log`

### Log Analysis

- **record.log**: Check for successful server starts and connections
- **errors.log**: Look for specific error messages and stack traces
- Console output: Real-time status and error information
